# Magic: The Gathering card replica in HMTL and CSS 

## License 
All mana, tap, images and card symbols are copyright and owned by [Wizards of the coast](http://company.wizards.com).

## Goal
I wanted to practice and improve my CSS skills so I decided to replicate a [Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) card in pure HTML and CSS. Specifically, the card I chose is [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) from the expansion [Oath of the Gatewatch](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Oath_of_the_Gatewatch) released in January 22, 2016. 
Why? Because artistically is one of my favourites!
